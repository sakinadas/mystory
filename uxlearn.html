		<center><p>A design that shows the basic principles a UX designer must adhere to. The layout is <b>responsive, readable and clean </b>. </p>

			<h4 class="customh4">What users look for?</h4>
				<p>As a user reading articles, blogs or any material online I look for subtle colors, fonts and text that is readable. 
			<h4 class=customh4>Persona</h4>
				<p>As for a walkthrough I created a persona and lets name her Mary. Mary is an engineer whose main resource for reading is online. Her data is as below.</p>
			<div class="persona"><img src="images/uxlearn/persona.png"></div> <br>
			<h4 class=customh4>Requirement Gathering</h4>
				<p>To create the perfect layout for Mary it was important to understand her 1. current behaviour using online tools, 2. Her expectations from the design, 3. How many hours does she usually spend into reading online material, 4. her desires and pains when using the product etc. Based on the discussion I chalked out her requirements to ensure all grey areas were covered.</p>
				<div class="requirementgathering"><img src="images/uxlearn/discussing-user-goals.png"><img src="images/uxlearn/requirement.png"> </div> 
				<p>It features a visually appealing font style and size, that is eaisly adaptive to different screen sizes. <br>
				The colors are used such that they highlight the title of the content and yet are not very distractive while reading the content text. They mark separations between 2 different topics.<br></p>
			<h4 class=customh4>Analysis</h4>
				<p>Based on all the requirements, mockups, sample designs and understanding her needs I came up with a design to suit her needs.</p>

		<h2 class="caption"><center>Mockups for different device types.</center></h2>
		<p>Mary also teaches students of high school and says she sometimes needs to read material off her phone. It was important to show her how the pages would display on different screens and ensure she was happy and satisfied with the results.</p>

		<h2 class="caption"><center>Evaluation and Conclusion</center></h2>
		<p>The overall product displays a couple of vital elemets. <br><br>
			<b>FONT: </b>The fonts are used and selected taking into consideration that the text would be read a lot times, on different screens, under different lights and by a varying range of ages. This way the text even if zoomed out or in does not have hanging edges that may cause an obstruction in reading under different circumstances.<br><br>
			<b>COLORS: </b>The colors chosen were to help them define as markers for different sections while also making it a little jazzy. The alternative would be to have them in basic colors but the subtle shade of the oranges and blues do not strain the eye.<br><br>
			<b>FUTURE SCOPE: </b>There are many different ways this design can be modified. My experiment will be to try different background colors, add more visuals and less text and change the color to a more lighter shade. <br><br>- Stay tuned for more modifications.</p>
