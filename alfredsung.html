		<h1 class="h1-1"><center>Case Study: Afred Sung E-commerce Site Redesign</center></h1>
		<hr>
		<h2 class="caption h2-2">Introduction</h2>
		<p>A few days ago, I was shopping online and happened to view the AlfredSung.com site. At first, it seemed normal like any other site but then I felt lost. The reason is for the first 3-4 seconds nothing came up on the screen. And, no, I don’t mean the site was loading libraries or downloading huge images, I mean that there was NO MENU BAR. I could not move ahead. The first few sections when the site needs to impress the user were lost. After the menu finally showed up I had to drill down deep in the menu (maybe 4-5 or even 6) clicks. Time consuming! When I finally got to what I was looking for, there was just an image and 1-line text about Alfred Sung. A shop online somewhere hidden at the bottom. </p>

		<h2 class="caption h2-2">Challenges</h2>
			<p>Based on the above experience the annoyance is that if I need to go to some other link to shop online, then where was I right now? I coupled together some questions and ideas I had to make to the site more appealing to the user. </p>

		<!-- <h3 class="caption h3-3">Questions & Ideas</h3> -->

		<p>
			<b>TRUST:</b> A site's main purpose is to ensure the user gets his/ her task fulfilled. Even though the site had information it was hidden all over with no links, hints or icons. As a famous designer, having a summary of Alfred Sung would help users understand whose product they are buying. This is essential to build a trust between the company and client. <br>
			<b>NAVIGATION: </b> visible menu bar and next / previous icons or links are essential to help jump back and forth between pages.<br>
			<b>IMAGES:</b> Having bright (not hurtful), interesting images can engage users thus having them spend more time on your site. Most of the time users skip text either due to time constraints or it's just simple boring and lengthy. Giving a visual idea about things catches the eye and psychologically can increase the will to buy the product or dig deeper if it appeals the user.</p>
		

		<h3 class="caption h3-3">Design and Logo Inspiration</h3>
				<p>I also did some personal research to get an insight into what the brand is all about and a little of its history and owner. As seen, Alfred Sung is a Canadian-Chinese fashion designer and since there is a hint of China there I best thought to design a logo close to heart. My logo contains English letters but also has his initials in Chinese script thus connecting with a larger audience and keeping traditional aspect.</p>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Research</h2>

			<h6 class="caption h6-6">User Research</h6>
			<ul>
				<li>ADDED INFORMATION: Users need to trust the product for which they need to have some information about the owner and the business. Understanding the uniqueness of the product helps users make faster choices. Security, customer support, package, shipping and delivery, return policies and disclaimers are things that build trust and connect shoppers to sites.
				</li>
				<li>FEEDBACK: A feedback form or link also helps build a strong connection between shoppers and the business. The idea that they can write to you about a good experience or give a bad feedback assures shoppers that they are in good hands and someone cares and listens to their requests. Most people who fill feedback forms have a high rate of returning to your site.</li>
				<li>FUNCTIONALITY: Clear functionality and call to action are a must. Shopping is fun during a sale, season or event. Keeping such information in full view is a great entry for people and a good chance to grab attention. </li>
			</ul>
				
			<h5 class="caption h5-5">User concerns</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Giving out credit card information, home or any address and having clear return options are top requirements of a user from its client. Skipping any of these drops the chances of a client purchase from your store / site. Shipping facility, cost and time tracking should be clearly given to avoid hidden costs or loss of product in trasit. Giving the shoppers a tool or medium to track their shipment calms the user to a great extent and they are more likely to shop again if the product is received in good condition, neatly packeged and on-time.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Persona</h2>
			<p>After understanding the user requirements and challenges they face I created a persona that had some common traits of all users. Focusing on her needs and helped me create a straight layout and avoided distractions of more ideas or features that may not be the need of the hour.</p>
			<div class="persona"><img src="images/alfredsung/persona.png"></div>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">User Journey</h2>
			<p>Keeping the user persona in mind I created a user journey indicating the obstacles the user might encounter while using the website. It shows what the user thinks, does, his/her thoughts and feels at every point.</p>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Flowchart</h2>
			<p>User journey outline on a broader perspective.</p>
			<div class="flowchart"><img src="images/alfredsung/Flowchart.png"></div>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Sketches & Wireframes</h2>
			<p>I roughly created some sketches to lay the design on paper and visually confirm that the picture I have in mind is as required. I drew these on paper first and later used mock plus to create the wireframes.<br><br>The below visuals represent the skeletal framework of the site. This process helped me lay the images, logo, text, headers, captions etc. in the right order and helped me identify and fix any visible functional issues that may hamper the user journey. I also decided on a few font styles that could be used and their sizes based on the area I had for texts and headings.</p>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Storyboard</h2>
			<p>I created a storyboard more like a narrative experience showing the overall usage of the app in a broad context.</p>

			<div class="storyboard">

				<div><img src="images/alfredsung/storyboard/2.png"></div>

			</div>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Typography</h2>
			<p>Verdana is a humanist sans-serif typeface. Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution computer screens. It has a large x-height (tall lower-case characters), with wider proportions and loose letter-spacing than on print-orientated designs like Helvetica.</p>
			<div><img src="images/alfredsung/fonts.png"></div>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Color Palette</h2>
			<p>The color grey symbolizes Formality, Neutrality, Sophistication. Hence, I have used grey text and 2 types of shades to compliment the background in black / white. The formality and sophistication aspect aligns with the designer’s sense of high quality and rich product. The grey text also helps soothe the overall look for user’s that do not like constrating shades.</p>
			<div><img style="height: 16rem;" src="images/alfredsung/color.png"></div>

			<h2 class="caption h2-2">Icons & Illustrations</h2>
			<p>The illustrations and icons are an important part of the design. They communicate ideas and concepts that should not and sometimes cannot be communicated with words. Furthermore, they allow consistency of the visual aesthetics that help build the users’ trust and produce moments of delight.</p>
