  	<h2>How it started.</h2>
  	  <p>A few days ago, I was shopping online for a wedding I had to attend, and happened to view the AlfredSung.com site. At first, it seemed normal like any other site but then I felt lost. The reason is for the first 3-4 seconds nothing came up on the screen. And, no, I donâ€™t mean the site was loading libraries or downloading huge images, I mean that there was NO navigation. I could not move ahead. The first few sections when the site needs to impress the user were lost. <br><br>I was on my phone and decided to give a try from the desktop. Still no luck. The phone site was not functional or useful. I realized then that the scope was in need of a makeover since it was lacking the major factor to make it a big success.</p>

    <h2>My Role.</h2>
  	  <p>Solely completed the re-designing of the project and created a mobile friendly application.</p>

  	<h2>Challenges to solve.</h2>
  	  <p>I was motivated to make the site responsive, add more product information and add an easy checkout process where users could trust the site with their personal information and also track their product shipments and delivery.<br>I also felt the need to have a search option and a more sortable list of items with additional filter options. </p>

  	<h2>Interviews</h2>
  	<p>Based on my experiences I realized there was more potential to the website and decided to refactor it. I began my journey by doing some basic research about what the intent of this website is and what it needs or is trying to showcase. At the discovery phase of my project, I conducted user interviews in order to get a better understanding of the problem.</p>
  	
  	<h3>Guiding Questions:</h3>
  	<ul>
  		<li>What are the most attractive elements on a website? What appeals to a user?</li>
		<li>I interviewed about 30-35 users asking them for what features they look for when shopping online.</li>
		<li>I understood that shipping, delivery and 3rd party verification for security are top concerns.</li>
		<li>Users had to believe the legitimacy of the site.</li>
		<li>They looked for product reviews and images of reviewed items.</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h3>What I tried to solve:</h3>
  	<p>My aim was to enable security for the application to enhance user trust. I planned to provide in depth details about shipping, delivery and package tracking. I also aimed to ensure user information security and in-grain more interactivity and make the application more usable.
  	</p>

  	<h3>My designs under test:</h3>
  	<p>I devised an initial version for the user journey of the checkout page and tested it with a sketch sample to get more user feedback. I designed a checkout page with a "trusted verification source mark" and examined the reactions of users who initially were hesitant to checkout because of the lack of trust.</p>

  		<img class="test1" src="images/wf3.png">
  	</div>


  	<h3>Test Conclusions:</h3>
  	<p>After testing out the designs I had them tested by a group of already application using members as well as new members. A large amount of users said they found the application trustworthy and would checkout the itemns without a doubt. They had no fear of giving out their card details since the application was verified and seemed legitimate.</p>

  	<h2>Survey</h2>

  	<h3>After acheiving user trust I needed to solve the interaction issues with the application.</h3>
  	<p>The application was limited to liksting one product of any category, no search options, no links to add to cart or checkout, no price tags, sizes, color options or sort functionality. This was another area where a survey followed with some interviews was conducted. My most common questions for users in the surevey were:</p>

  	<ul>
  		<li>What is the first you look for in a site.</li>
		<li>How much time do you invest in navigating the site if you do not find the product instantly?</li>
		<li>Which other sites do you visit after leaving this one?</li>
		<li>What attracts you about the other sites?</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h3>Surevy and interview results</h3>
  	<p>Based on the above questions I understood that users typically spend 10 minutes on the site looking for the poduct. If they do not find the item they are easily annoyed and the probability of drifting away increases. Since there are visible naigation issues with no access to cart or purchasing and the lack of filters, some users do not manually look through each item. A no feedback zone makes the users feel less valuable. Overall, trusting and shopping on the site is an unsatisfied experience.</p>

  	<h3>Market Analysis</h3>
  	<p>I conducted market analysis of the sites the users diverted to. To make this website and application more fruitful I ensured that I was a step ahead of the competitors. Ensuring I had features that they had and add more to those would help me generate more lead for this site.</p>

  	<h3>Key comparision results</h3>
  	<ul>
  		<li>Login page / sign up option that helps generate leads and follow up with users to provide deals and discounts.</li>
		<li>Recommended products based on search history and past purchase.</li>
		<li>Add to list options for tracking to get notified in case of price change or item availibility.</li>
		<li>Push notifications to get updates for product modifications, price drop and rise, shipping and similar or newer relevant items.</li>
  	</ul>

  	<h3>User pain points:</h3>
  	<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>

  	<h2>Persona</h2>
  	<p>Based on the survey and interviews conducted I came up with 2 different personas. A. The set of users that did not worry about giving a feedback as long as the product arrived intact. These users also did not mind spending time on looking up items manually as long as they found the right item. B. These users were last minute buyers that looked for specifically an item and preferred filter options and price tags to narrow down their results. They required a mobile version so they could shop on the go and also were strict about having a secure transaction.</p>

  	<h2>User Journey</h2>
  	<p>After analysing the results I came up with a user journey map that describes the way the the user interacts with the system. It enables to highlight the call to actions, pain points, data transfer and opportunities for improvement.
  	The user journey has 4 main stages as depicted below.</p>
  	<ul><li>1. Aware</li><li>2. Research</li><li>3. Decision</li><li>4. Post purchase or transaction.</li></ul>

  	<h2>Final Conclusion</h2>
  	<p>I finally have a visual representation of the end product that includes the services and functionality that are highly demanded.
  	With these designs I performed a usability testing amongst the people I interviewed. On final steps I received a feedback that a. the users would happily sign-up for this site. b. Make it their most used site over-time if the products hold as promised. c. The fear of legitimacy had almost been removed.</p>
  	<p>The layout can be implemented using HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap or css grid structure and JavaScript, jQuery to provide on-page-load and other run-time effects.</p>
